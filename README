To build all Benchmarks just type "make all"

TODO:

* Update mynvcc with a more intuitive usage. (Maybe we should also change it's name).
* Modularize and insert comments on files, so people can understand what they do and how they work internally.
* Put every dependence for the benchmarks in the dependence folder.
* Create simple and clean Makefiles to build each benchmark
* Arrange the benchmarks in the benchmark folder, so we are able to see where are we going.
